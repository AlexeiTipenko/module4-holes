# Distant Reading with TexTexture

Some of the tools we've looked at don't so much analyze our texts as provide us a new lens through which to view them. This is in line with the contrast that Trevor Owens draws in humanities computing: between [deformation and justification](http://www.trevorowens.org/2012/11/discovery-and-justification-are-different-notes-on-sciencing-the-humanities/). It's a theme around which Stephen Ramsay builds his engaging book, [Reading Machines](http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Machines-Algorithmic-Criticism-Humanities/dp/0252078209). (I'd strongly recommend you get a copy of this book). In this tutorial, we'll use the [TexTexture](http://textexture.com/) tool to transform a text into a network, and then engage in some close/distant reading of that text-as-network.

## How TexTexture works
There are many ways a body of text could be represented as a network. The obvious objection is that texts are not networks! If however we make semantic sense of a text by understanding the grammatical relationships between words that are close together, and deeper sense by considering the juxtaposition of words within the text as a whole, then it's not inappropriate to apply the kaleidascope of a network to create productive juxtapositions and breaks that make us ponder more deeply.
